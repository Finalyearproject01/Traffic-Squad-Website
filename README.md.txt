About This Project
Traffic Squad is an app that helps the police as well as the police by means of time and efficiency. The increasing importance of corruption has become a major factor. The existing system makes the use of pen and paper which is a challan that is given to the offender for breaking the traffic rules. As the system consists of paperwork the papers mostly get damaged or tempered. Now the population of the day has become an important factor to consider as a result the number of vehicles grows by increasing vehicle registration issues, license registration, emission testing and insurance validity for RTO departments, and verification of vehicle documents. RTO employees have a lot of workloads to perform registration, licensing, transfer, etc., which requires a lot of paperwork. As a result, people can not do things at the right time, which is a loss of time and energy. Likewise, the owner of the vehicle sometimes forgets to carry the license and forgets the insurance at the time of the investigation. secure app for you.
